# COVID-19: Evolution of Covid-19 Pandemic

## 1.0 Introduction to Project

### 1.1 Overview

The analysis presented here aims to explore the intricate patterns and trends within the amalgamated COVID-19 dataset, derived from reputable sources such as Our World in Data for COVID-19 cases. This research seeks to answer key questions related to the combined impact of COVID-19 cases and other factors included in the dataset. By examining these key factors, we aim to understand what happened throughout this pandemic and identify important implementations that helped ease our lives back to normal.

### 1.2 Primary Questions Guiding the Analysis

The key **4 main factors** that influence the COVID-19 pandemic and will be analyzed are:

1. Economical Factor
2. Sociological Factor
3. Health Factor
4. Demographic Factor

The guiding questions and considerations include:

1. How has the interplay between COVID-19 cases and vaccination efforts evolved over time globally and regionally?
2. Are there any correlations between and within factors, and if so, what are they?
3. Are COVID-19 cases expected to increase or decrease?
4. What is the highest correlation between factors in the Economical, Sociological, Health, and Demographic categories?

This research is crucial for gaining insights into the combined patterns of infection and vaccination, providing an informative view that can inform future strategies for managing and preventing the spread of infectious diseases. Additionally, it will help us understand the impact and significance of this pandemic.
